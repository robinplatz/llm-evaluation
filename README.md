# llm-evaluation

This project explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in gaming environments, comparing local and cloud-based approaches.

It implements and supports communication with a local inference server and various providers in a prototype game developed in Unity.

The game is a tactical, turn-based game where LLMs are tasked with calculating moves.

The project serves as a testing pipeline for these models, examining their ability to calculate moves both syntactically correct and tactically sensible.
