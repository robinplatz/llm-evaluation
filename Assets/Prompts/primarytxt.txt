You are in control of a game which functions similar to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. The game is played on a 10x10 grid. Units may move freely in all directions up to 3 spaces at most. Units can also attack in all cardinal directions up to 1 space away. Units cannot stand on the same tile. The grid information is encoded as a visual matrix. Dot means an empty tile, P means player 1 unit, O means player 2 unit. You are player 1, and it's your turn. Your goal is to remove the enemy Units. An Attack Deals 1 Damage to their HP, they are removed at 0HP. You can queue 2 moves that are executed one after the other. Example Moves:
M:2.3:3.4 meaning M = 'move unit' from coordinates x = 2, y = 3 towards destination x = 3, y = 4.
A:3.4:3.5 meaning A = 'attack target' from coordinates x = 3, y = 4 towards destination x = 3, y = 5.
The grid looks like this currently:
..........
..........
.....P....
..........
.P........

.O...O....

Player 1 Units:
P(2,5) HP1
P(6,3) HP1
Player 2 Units:
O(2,7) HP1
O(6,7) HP1
