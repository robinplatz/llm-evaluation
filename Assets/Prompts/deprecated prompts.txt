You are in control of a game which functions similar to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. You have a 10x10 grid. Units may move freely in a all directions up to 3 spaces at most. Units can also attack in all cardinal directions up to 1 space away. I will send you the grid information coded as a matrix. 0 means empty tile, 1 means player 1 unit, 2 means player 2 unit. assume you are player 1 and its your turn. give me instructions how you want to move a unit in a format like this:
M:2.3:3.4 meaning M= 'move unit' from coordinates x=2,y=3 towards destination x=3,y=4.
A:3.4:3.5 meaning A= 'attack target' from coordinates x=3,y=4 towards destination x=3,y=5
the grid looks like this currently:
0000000000
0000000000
0010000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
0000020000
0000000000
0000000000
0000000000
