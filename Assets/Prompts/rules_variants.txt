You are in control of a game which functions similar to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. The game is played on a 14x14 grid. Units may move freely in all directions up to 3 spaces at most.
Units can also attack in all cardinal directions up to 1 space away. Units cannot stand on the same tile.
The grid information is encoded as a visual matrix. Dot means an empty tile, P means player 1 unit, O means player 2 unit.
Your goal is to remove the enemy Units. An Attack Deals 1 Damage to their HP, they are removed at 0HP.
You can queue 2 moves that are executed one after the other. Using Example Coordinates, Moves are structured like this:
M:2.3:3.4 meaning M = 'move unit' from coordinates 2,3 towards destination 3,4.
A:3.4:3.5 meaning A = 'attack target' from coordinates 3,4 towards destination 3,5.
The grid currently looks like this:
